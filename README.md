# 🐾 Exploring Animal Health Patterns 🐾

Welcome to the **Exploring Animal Health Patterns** project! This initiative goes beyond simple classification to dive deep into the "Animal Condition Classification Dataset." By analyzing patterns and trends in animal health conditions across different species, we aim to uncover valuable insights that can benefit veterinarians, conservationists, and pet owners alike.

## 🌟 Project Overview

This project explores the "Animal Condition Classification Dataset" to:

- **Identify Common Symptoms**: Discover the most frequent symptoms across various species.
- **Understand Species-Specific Health Issues**: Analyze how different species exhibit health problems.
- **Detect Trends in Symptom Severity**: Uncover patterns that indicate the severity of health conditions.

By leveraging **data visualization**, we aim to provide actionable insights that can help in predicting and managing animal health risks more effectively.

## 🔍 Research Questions

Our exploration is guided by the following key questions:

1. **What are the most common symptoms across different species, and do certain symptoms appear more frequently in dangerous conditions?**
2. **Are there specific animal species that are more prone to dangerous health conditions?**
3. **Is there a relationship between symptom combinations and the likelihood of a dangerous condition?**
4. **Do different species share similar health risk patterns, or are there species-specific symptoms that stand out?**

## 🛠️ Tools & Techniques

- **Data Analysis**: Python (Pandas, NumPy)
- **Data Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly
- **Machine Learning**: Scikit-learn (for initial classification tasks)
- **Interactive Dashboards**: Streamlit

## 📊 Expected Outcomes

- **Interactive Visualizations**: Engaging charts and graphs that highlight key findings.
- **Species-Specific Insights**: Detailed reports on health risks for different species.
- **Symptom Correlation Analysis**: Understanding how symptom combinations relate to dangerous conditions.
